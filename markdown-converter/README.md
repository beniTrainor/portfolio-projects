# Markdown Previewer

Include motivation, rationale, decisions made about how to parse/convert, inline vs. whole line, etc.

Write if anything has been left out from the Markdown specification.

Example:
No tables (even if they are not part of the Markdown spec)
No task lists
No footnotes
No inline HTML

---

For simplicity I have left out some features from the Markdown syntax/specification (TODO: find out if there's a specification)


This web project is designed for medium to big screens, not mobile. I don't see the need to have the app functioning on small screens.

---

Note: abstain from separating whole line fron inline functions. Since it's only going to be used for this project it's not necessary, it's better to keep it simpler.

I have left out: 
- headings with underlines.
- multi-level lists

A lot of the CSS styling for the HTML output has been reversed engineered (or copied) from GitHub.

Note: this app is not designed to be used on mobile screens. It is optimized for desktop use.
